I was a bit worried since I ordered items that needed to be refrigerated and the tracking page said that the order was on its way for 48 hours now,  but since I know you guys manage a lot of orders, I decided to wait for it to come as offered. I waited from 6 till 9pm and no one came, I even checked with one of your agents named Henry and he said that the order must be on its way so I continued to wait for it. Finally, the order arrived 4 days after it was supposed to and some of the items were already rotten.  As you can imagine, I was really frustrated by this, but I was going to leave it like that until I realized that a big part of my order was still missing. I checked the website to see what happened to it since they were coming on 2 separate trucks, it said that the other part I was missing from the order was delivered to address 42 Maple St\nHudson Falls, New York (NY), 12839 which is funny as I am not even close to that! Then, I called the carrier\u00b4s company so that they could explain to me where my order was, they, unfortunately, couldn\u2019t tell me anything.  They just apologized and said that a full refund was going to be issued on the card used in the purchase which is [CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER].  They additionally said that I was also going to get a promo code with them for the inconveniences this caused me, nevertheless,  I was naturally still very upset, but decided to trust them and continued with my day.    Later when I checked my statement of account nothing was there. This made me even more upset as they were supposed to issue me a refund and they did not. I emailed them to their contact email address [EMAIL] and the representative just said that this was not their fault and that they were not the ones who needed to process the refund but you guys should process it directly.

I was a bit worried since I ordered items that needed to be refrigerated and the tracking page said that the order was on its way for 48 hours now,  but since I know you guys manage a lot of orders, I decided to wait for it to come as offered. I waited from 6 till 9pm and no one came, I even checked with one of your agents named Henry and he said that the order must be on its way so I continued to wait for it. Finally, the order arrived 4 days after it was supposed to and some of the items were already rotten.  As you can imagine, I was really frustrated by this, but I was going to leave it like that until I realized that a big part of my order was still missing. I checked the website to see what happened to it since they were coming on 2 separate trucks, it said that the other part I was missing from the order was delivered to address 42 Maple St\nHudson Falls, New York (NY), 12839 which is funny as I am not even close to that! Then, I called the carrier\u00b4s company so that they could explain to me where my order was, they, unfortunately, couldn\u2019t tell me anything.  They just apologized and said that a full refund was going to be issued on the card used in the purchase which is [CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER].  They additionally said that I was also going to get a promo code with them for the inconveniences this caused me, nevertheless,  I was naturally still very upset, but decided to trust them and continued with my day.

All of the wallpaper has been removed and the original plaster walls have been patched and painted.  \n        The Fergusons are striving to return the house to its original condition.  The restoration process has been made easier due to the fact that the house was very well built and had always been loved and well cared for.  The Fergusons have three daughters, Shaylee, Britney, and Leanne.  Their youngest daughter Shaylee was very young when they bought the house.  The Fergusons hope their grandchildren will someday play in the house at 4820 Garrett Street Newark PA.

This month, I'm going to cover why \"Fall is for Families!\" It's no secret that fall is the busiest time for most photographers. Lots of people want that coveted 'fall colors' image of the fam for their annual holiday card. And why wouldn't you, it's a beautiful time of the year! The heat and busyness of the summer has died down and with cooler temps and changing leaf colors, families start to think about doing a portrait session. For some, it's an annual event that's scheduled well in advance. For others, it's the first session their family has done together in years...maybe even decades! I once had a family who hadn't had portraits taken since 2015! And that's okay, it makes our session together all the more special. Why is fall such a popular time for portraits? Simply put, COLOR. Mother nature is showing off this time of year, there's no denying it! THE LIGHT. The quality of light during the fall season is unlike any other time of the year. The sun gives us fewer hours of daylight, but what we do get is light that's rich, soft and beautiful. That kind of light makes for some really striking portraits. Again, mother nature showing us that no matter how hard we try to emulate, she's cornered the market on awesome lighting! Fall portraits start on Sep 22 and typically wrap up around Oct 23, but due to the weather, amount of rain, etc...each year can vary a bit. Speaking of rain - don't let it worry you. If your session falls on a day that ends up being less than awesome, we simply reschedule for a date and time that works for all of us! Between the pretty scenery and temperate weather, families have plenty of reasons to love fall. Time is running out to get your fall session in this year - drop me a line at coloryourlife@portraits.com or give me a call at [TELEPHONE_NUMBER] to book yours before all the leaves are gone! As always, happy shooting!

Again, mother nature showing us that no matter how hard we try to emulate, she's cornered the market on awesome lighting! Fall portraits start on Sep 22 and typically wrap up around Oct 23, but due to the weather, amount of rain, etc...each year can vary a bit. Speaking of rain - don't let it worry you. If your session falls on a day that ends up being less than awesome, we simply reschedule for a date and time that works for all of us! Between the pretty scenery and temperate weather, families have plenty of reasons to love fall. Time is running out to get your fall session in this year - drop me a line at coloryourlife@portraits.com or give me a call at [TELEPHONE_NUMBER] to book yours before all the leaves are gone! As always, happy shooting!

They tested positive today, have symptoms, and are in school. I understand that the schools cannot police every student, but something needs to be done. People who attend school, and parents who knowingly send their children to school when they are covid positive need to be held accountable and measures need to be taken to stop this from happening. I\u2019ve been told for months that kids in the high school disregard the mask mandate all the time. They either wear the mask under their chin, or not at all, and they receive no repercussions for their refusal to wear a mask. This is unacceptable, especially now knowing that there are students in the building walking around with Covid. And while anyone over the age of 12 is eligible to get the Covid vaccine, given the current culture of this community, I'm not optimistic that the vaccination rate in our district is very high.  I understand that the staff and teachers are probably very tired of trying to enforce masks, especially at the high school level. However, there are parents like myself who are comfortable with sending their children to school ONLY because there is a mask mandate in place for everyone\u2019s safety. If this is being disregarded and there are no plans to actively enforce masks or ensure that people who are Covid positive do not attend school, then I cannot trust that the schools are doing what they can to promote health and safety for everyone in the buildings. Since the start of this pandemic on February 2019, I\u2019ve truly felt that our district has done everything possible to keep the students and the community safe. I know that everyone is worn down and tired of life not being \u2019normal\u2019- something like \u2018pandemic fatigue\u2019. It would seem that the district is also suffering from this too, if safety measures are slipping and masks are not even being enforced. I want to trust that my kids are as safe as possible when I send them to school, but with each passing week this school year, that trust is slipping. If there is anything being done to prevent Covid positive students from attending school - other than just trusting their parents to be honest and keep them home if they are sick - please let me know. Perhaps there\u2019s something in place that I\u2019m not aware of.
